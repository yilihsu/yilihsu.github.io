I earned my PhD from the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.umd.edu/){:target="\_blank"} at the University of Maryland, College Park, advised by [Prof. David Mount](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/){:target="\_blank"}. My research interests lie generally in Theoretical Computer Science, including Computational Geometry, Approximation Algorithms, and Data Structures. I'm always looking for research opportunities, just contact me!

My research revolves around the goal of achieving more efficient _nearest-neighbor classification_, showing results that are practical for large-scale applications, while also having provable theoretical guarantees. This work focuses on two main subjects. First, on the development and analysis of algorithms to reduce the training set used for classification. These reduced subsets can be either heuristically obtained \[[CCCG'19](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/conf/cccg/Flores-VelazcoM19.html?view=bibtex){:target="\_blank"}, [CCCG'20](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/conf/cccg/Flores-Velazco20.html?view=bibtex){:target="\_blank"}\] or $$ \varepsilon $$-coresets \[[ESA'20](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/conf/esa/Flores-VelazcoM20.html?view=bibtex){:target="\_blank"}\]. Additionally, I've been working on proposing new data structures specially tailored for answering $$ \varepsilon $$-approximate nearest-neighbor classification queries \[[ESA'21](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/conf/esa/Flores-VelazcoM21.html?view=bibtex)\], achieving the lowest complexity of any approach so far.

I completed my undegraduate studies at [Universidad Simón Bolívar](http://www.usb.ve/){:target="\_blank"}, Venezuela, earning a BEng. in Computer Science, _Cum Laude_. During those years, I had the pleasure of working with great people. First, with [Prof. María-Esther Vidal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vDyk0JgAAAAJ){:target="\_blank"}, on topics related to Semantic Web and Graph Databases (see [publications](publications/)). Additionally, I was advised by [Prof. Emely Arráiz](https://dblp.org/pid/43/4098.html){:target="\_blank"} towards my undegraduate thesis, titled _Bio-Inspired Metaheuristics for Instance Selection_, which was awarded an _outstanding honorable mention_ by the committee.

Born and raised in [Venezuela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela){:target="\_blank"} :venezuela:. My country lives under a [dictatorship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEvHwiJWgAY){:target="\_blank"} that has forced over 5M people to flee. [Venezuela](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-weCrwaqu9Q){:target="\_blank"} deserves to be _free_, and we will never stop fighting. During my free time, I enjoy [photography](https://www.instagram.com/p/CPdj_AQjC15/){:target="\_blank"} (specially [macro photography](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5DL7p9jA2o/){:target="\_blank"}), [biking](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFXL4EbjRy-/){:target="\_blank"}, [hiking](https://www.instagram.com/p/B0_X_fYD5LV/){:target="\_blank"}, [dancing](https://www.instagram.com/p/BnRRf-mFJ5w/){:target="\_blank"}, and cooking.

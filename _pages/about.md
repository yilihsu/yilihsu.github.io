I am currently in the first year of my Ph.D. from the [Department of Computer Science](https://dcs-en.site.nthu.edu.tw/index.php){:target="\_blank"} at National Tsing Hua University, supervised by [Prof. Lun-Wei Ku](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/lwku/index_en.html) at Academia Sinica ,[Prof. Aiping Xiong](https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/axx29/) at Penn State University, and [Prof. Wei-Kuan Shih](https://dblp.org/pid/16/5006.html) at National Tsing Hua University. My research interests generally lie in Natural Language Processing, Text generation, and Deep learning. I am currently applying for visiting scholar position.

My current research revolves around generating fake news explanations, showing that counterfactual explanations are more effective than warning tags and summarization-based explanations. Additionally, I have been working on proposing a new method incorporating semantic graphs to better capture the context across the line and Elaboration Likelihood Model to customize explanations for each individual.

Before my current study, I got a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at National Tsing Hus University and did graduate research with [Prof. Yuan-Hao Chang](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~johnson/) on optimization of non-volatile memory storage architecture.
